# Angular Technical Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Structure

The project includes one page (app.component) where a product list is shown, and a form to create a new product.

The candidate must:
- Fetch the list of products from the correct endpoint [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs)
- Connect the form to the controller to send a newly created product to the API (and append it to the products array)
